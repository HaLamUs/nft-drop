## Detail 
### React/Next.js 
```
APP.js --> index.js --> Main --> Header, NFTDisplay, Hero
```

#### React Hook
  - âœ… The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
        </br>Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
<br/> Example:
```js
useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // conditions meet
```

        Replace class, componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate
  - âœ… The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
      </br>State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.
<br/> Example:        
```js
const [brand, setBrand] = useState("Ford"); // const brand = "Ford" intial value 
const [model, setModel] = useState("Mustang");
const [me, setMe] = useState(); // meaning me-variable has nil value 
```

 ### Solana
 1. IDE
    https://beta.solpg.io
2. Libs
    https://www.metaplex.com
#### NFT
    include 2 files: 0.jpg, 0.json
    <br/>The json file is where you define NFT's properties: hat, ears, eyes (blue)

#### How are NFTs stored?
We do not save the raw/origin png to Solana chain, we use a 3rd party (candy machine) for hosting assets and keep the id (reference keys) in blockchain

#### Sugar candy 
  With this powerful tool, you can guard your NFT 

  Example: Add start/end date, bot tax

  ðŸ“Œ Remember to change the wallet payment with your address.

## The END
ðŸ˜Œ For me, no RUST code actually typing is amazing. When you are the fullstack, you must take advantage of those libs around you.
<br/> P/s: NFT properties so kool ðŸ¤˜

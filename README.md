## Detail 
### React/Next.js 
#### React Hook
  - âœ… The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
        </br>Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
    
        Replace class, componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate
  - âœ… The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
      </br>State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.
<br/> Example:        
```js
const [brand, setBrand] = useState("Ford");
const [model, setModel] = useState("Mustang");
```

#### How are NFTs stored?
We do not save the raw/origin png to Solana chain, we use a 3rd party (candy machine) for hosting assets and keep the id (reference keys) in blockchain
